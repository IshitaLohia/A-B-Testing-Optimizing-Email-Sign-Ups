Project Overview:
I designed and executed an A/B test to help Urban Wear optimize email sign-ups on their pre-launch page. The experiment tested whether changing the submit button color from blue (control) to green (treatment) would improve conversion rates and maximize sign-ups before the eCommerce launch.

What I Did:

Cleaned and explored the data to handle missing values and ensure accuracy.
Split users into control and treatment groups for comparison.
Calculated conversion rates and ran a Z-test to determine statistical significance.
Visualized results using Python libraries and presented key findings to stakeholders.
Results:

The green button significantly boosted email sign-ups, showing a statistically significant improvement (p-value < 0.05).
Recommended adopting the green button design, leading to a measurable increase in conversions.
Challenges I Overcame:

Managed data imbalance with stratified sampling to ensure fair group comparisons.
Addressed missing data using imputation techniques and validated the robustness of results.
Tools & Tech: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels), Seaborn, Matplotlib.
